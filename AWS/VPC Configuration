** VPC Configuration **

Project Goals : 

  => Create a VPC with custom IP ranges.

  => Configure public and private subnets.

  => Set up Internet Gateway (IGW) and NAT Gateway for internet access.

  => Implement Route Tables to control network traffic.

  => Deploy EC2 instances in both subnets.


Steps:

  1. Create a VPC
 
      a. Define a CIDR block: 10.0.0.0/16

  2. Create Subnets
 
      a. Public Subnet: 10.0.1.0/24 

      c. Private Subnet: 10.0.2.0/24 

  3. Configure Internet Gateway

      a. Create an Internet Gateway (IGW) to the VPC

      b. Modify the public subnetâ€™s Route Table to route internet-bound traffic via the IGW

      c. Set up a NAT Gateway in the public subnet to allow outbound internet access for instances in the private subnet


  4. Configure Route Tables
 
      a. Create Public Route Table

      b. Attach Public Subnet and Internet Gateway (IGW) to make server as public

      c. Attach Private subnet and NAT gateway to make server as public
  
      

  6. Deploy EC2 Instances

      a. Deploy a EC2 instance under public subnet and access via terminal

      b. Deploy a EC2 instance under private subnet and connect through public subnet

      c. Download packages from private subnet to ensure internet connection is proper
