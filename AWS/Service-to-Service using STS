**IAM Roles Service to Service (To provide s3 bucket access through EC2 instance)**

Purpose: To give temporary access to AWS service to users without creating IAM users. This will not require username and password. This uses STS(security token service)

Steps: 

  1. Go to Roles -> Create role -> AWS Service -> Use case=EC2-> Next-> Now provide permission for service (ex s3 full) -> Create role

  2. Open the created role -> under trust relationship we can see the JSON where mentioned as principal and we can set the timing as 1hr, 2hrs.

  3. Now we have given the access to S3 bucket through EC2 instace (Users having access to EC2 instance, they will get S3 access). 
      For this we need to attach the role to EC2.

  4. Go to EC2 section and select the instance.

  5. Click on Actions -> Security -> Modify IAM role -> select the role -> update IAM role.

  6. Now connect the EC2 instance and check for S3 bucket actions.
